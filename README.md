# bypass OpenVPN Access Server restrictions
### What is OpenVPN Access Server
OpenVPN Access Server is a convenient tool that is installed on the server in a couple of commands and allows you to comfortably work with clients: change subnets, profiles, passwords and other settings. Doing all this manually would be much more difficult.

The free version of OpenVPN Access Server has a connection limit: only two clients can connect at a time. A paid license, in addition to being expensive, is now impossible to physically pay for.
